# 🚦 Smart Traffic Light Control System using YOLO

This project implements an **AI-powered smart traffic light system** that dynamically controls signal timings using **real-time vehicle detection**. It eliminates unnecessary red light wait times by detecting traffic presence using the **YOLO object detection algorithm**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To reduce traffic congestion and improve fuel efficiency by:
- Automatically extending green signals when traffic is detected.
- Skipping unnecessary red lights when no traffic is present.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- 🧠 **YOLO-based vehicle detection** (cars, bikes, buses, trucks, etc.)
- ⚙️ Real-time decision logic for traffic light control
- 📈 Optimized green/red light durations based on detected traffic
- 🚫 No traffic = no red signal delay
- 🎥 Works with live video or pre-recorded footage

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV** – For video capture and frame processing
- **YOLOv4 / YOLOv5** – For object detection
- **NumPy** – Array operations

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Load YOLO model with pre-trained weights
2. Read frames from video or live webcam
3. Detect objects (vehicles) in each frame
4. Count number of vehicles per lane
5. If vehicle count exceeds a threshold:
       -> Extend green signal
   Else:
       -> Skip red and switch to next lane
6. Display updated signal status and bounding boxes
7. Repeat...

📚 Dataset Used
YOLO pre-trained on COCO dataset
Detects: car, bus, truck, motorcycle, bicycle, etc.

📌 Future Improvements
Integrate with Raspberry Pi or Arduino for real-world deployment
Add emergency vehicle detection
Use license plate recognition (ALPR) for rule enforcement
Log traffic density data for smart city analytics
